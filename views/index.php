		<div class="history">
			<p>I have been crocheting dolls of fictional characters since the summer of 2012, starting with Captain America. My original Cap doll was very primitive, but proved incredibly popular with my friends who encouraged me to being selling him and dolls like him online. While the dolls I offer now are much more polished and my knowledge and skill in crochet has significantly improved, all my dolls are made with the same love and care as that original Captain America.</p>
